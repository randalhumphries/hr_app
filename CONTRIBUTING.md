## Code of Conduct

This code of conduct is designed to keep this project's community respectful, supportive, and helpful.

### Summary

The code of conduct can be boiled down to respect, dignity, and courteousness. Harassment of anyone by any means in any context is simply unacceptable. Violators will be warned. Should the indicated behavior continue after two warnings, the violator(s) will be banned. All contributors, including me, are subject to this policy.

### In detail

This section is directly inspired by [thoughtbot's](https://thoughtbot.com/) Code of Conduct. A warm nod to those folks for treating harassment seriously and setting a good standard for harassment in their community.

Harassment includes any offensive verbal comments related to gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images, deliberate intimidation, stalking, sustained disruption, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Individuals asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If anyone engages in harassing behavior, I may take appropriate action, up to and including warning the offender, deletion of comments, removal from the projectâ€™s codebase and communication systems, and escalation to GitHub support.

If you are being harassed, believe that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact me immediately via GitHub or email at randal@randalhumphries.com.

Again, everyone is subject to this policy, including me, and is expected to treat everyone else with respect, dignity, and courteousness.

Finally, let's remember that imperfection is a very human quality. We all make mistakes, we were all newbies at some point, and no one knows everything. Our mistakes are an oppurtunity to learn and other's mistakes are an oppurtunity to teach. Let's be sure to capitilize on those oppurtunities and support each other in the journey to be better developers.
