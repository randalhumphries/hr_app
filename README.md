# HR App

A human resources app for healthcare organizations. It is designed with the various data that healthcare organizations have to track for both regulatory compliance and efficient management of their employees, contract workers, and the like.

## Getting Started

This section will be developed as the project is built and evolves.

### Prerequisites

These are the basic prerequisites for the HR App. See the [Built With](#built-with) section for a full list of the tools and gems used to develop this project.

* [Rails 5.1.4](http://rubyonrails.org/) - The core web framework.
* [PostgreSQL 9.6.4](https://www.postgresql.org/) - The database.

### Installing

This section will be built out as the project develops.

## Running the tests

HR App uses RSpec and Capybara for testing. The instructions for running these tests will be further described as they are built.
